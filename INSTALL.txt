INSTALL
-------
1.) Create a new Django Application to run this project on the Dropbox
    developers website: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps.  Take note
    that this is where you will recieve your DROPBOX_CONSUMER_KEY and
    DROPBOX_CONSUMER_SECRET settings from.
    
2.) Install django-dbbackup by running the following command:
    >> python setup.py install
    
3.) Add 'dbbackup' to INSTALLED_APPS in your Django settings.py file.

4.) Add the three required settings DROPBOX_CONSUMER_KEY,
    DROPBOX_CONSUMER_SECRET and DBBACKUP_TOKEN_FILEPATH to your Django
    settings.py file.  The secret and key variables are provided to within the
    options for your newly created Dropbox application.  The token filepath
    is the local location to store Dropbox oAuth tokens.
    (I set DBBACKUP_TOKEN_FILEPATH = '<PROJECT_ROOT>/dbbackup.tokens')
    
5.) You can now run the command "./manage.py dbbackup".  The first time you
    run this command you will be prompted verify your account by visiting a
    dropbox url.
    
6.) Run the command again and you should be up and running.
